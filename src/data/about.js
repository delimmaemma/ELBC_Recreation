            "Elkins Lake Baptist Church was chartered in 1971, a little more than fifty years ago, as a mission of First Baptist Church Huntsville. The original vision was to minister to weekend residents of the Elkins Lake Community. Beginning as a Bible study group, a small church facility was built to provide for a growing congregation. In 1997 the church moved to its current beautiful location on 30+ wooded acres.",
            "We are a unique group of people trying to be followers of Jesus Christ. Our heritage is Baptist, and we cooperate with many Baptist ministries and missions, but our members come from a variety of Christian backgrounds. We simply all agree to let God’s word in Jesus and Scripture be the guide for our lives.",
            "We are an intergenerational body of Christ striving to be God’s people in this time and place. Our membership is made up of educators, Texas Department of Criminal Justice workers, small business owners and professionals. A significant part of our fellowship is retired Senior Adults."

We have a blended contemporary and traditional style of worship with Praise Team and Choral music on Sundays and a Fellowship Meal with Bible Study and age specific activities on Wednesdays. Our current Sunday morning on campus attendance averages 120 in attendance. We also live stream our services on several different platforms.",
            "Our Mission Statement: Elkins Lake Baptist Church is a body of believers committed to create a safe environment where people can continually encounter, respond to, grow in, and live out the love of God found in Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit.",
            "Come see us this Sunday or Wednesday and find a home for yourself at Elkins Lake Baptist Church."
